# SimilarDoctor

A site contains a listing of doctors. Users can browse for doctors given a specific specialty, area, review score etc.

You need to help write the logic for returning similar doctors.  Specifically, write a class(es) which when given a doctor, provides a list of similar doctors, in a prioritized order. You define what similar means and the result ordering but clearly document any assumptions in your code.  Please include unit tests. You can assume the entire directory of doctors fits into memory.  Write in whatever language you're most comfortable with.
